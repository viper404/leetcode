Hi Humans!

Vincent here, from July 27th, 2016 till now, I have been keeping on solving algorithmic questions on [LeetCode OJ](https://leetcode.com/). It's a long-time-job to submit all of my solution to see whether I have solved them correctly, however, I want to be a JavaScript full stack developer and algorithms are the basics.
